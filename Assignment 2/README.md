It consisted in the following: 

A recent paper (DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0108567) executes a meta-analysis of a few thousand published co-expressed gene sets from Arabidopsis.  They break these co-expression sets into ~20 sub-networks of <200 genes each, that they find consistently co-expressed with one another.  Assume that you want to take the next step in their analysis, and see if there is already information linking these predicted sub-sets into known regulatory networks.  
One step in this analysis would be to determine if the co-expressed genes are known to bind to one another.

Using the co-expressed gene list from Table S2 of the supplementary data from their analysis (it is the txt file attached in this folder):

1. se a combination of any or all of:  dbFetch, Togo REST API, EBI’s PSICQUIC REST API, DDBJ KEGG REST, and/or the Gene Ontology
2. Find all protein-protein interaction networks that involve members of that gene list
Determine which members of the gene list interact with each other.
